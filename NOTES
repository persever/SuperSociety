(phase 3)
- CREATE USER MODEL (update phases)
- wait, just access server attendings/subscriptions with CURRENT_USER/event/group ids??????
- toggle join/unjoin buttons for event shows, and events indexitems!!!!!! then for group show
- get rid of currentUserManagedGroups assoc

(phase 4)
- filepicker for sign up but not sign in...
- make users/new route something more appropriate to dual functionality...
- make new users form not shared anymore? you need to make the naming more clear
- look up good practices for making single-page sing in/ups

- make group and events forms modals (also phase 4) (see trello project!!!!!!)


- if there are no notes above this, update the readme time expectations, close the issues, and push
- upgrade heroku, get it working

- phase 5
- make events index load with gorup info in search view, not in group view

> what's your current user assoc for group creation look like?? did you lose it??
- make nav (bootstrap navbar!!), see notes from lightnig lec
- guest signin autotype

- make every route call redirect to signin page if no current user... currently tacks it on....

- make filepicker more site appropriate
- make appropriate rails route hits redirect to appropriate static page route
- make group genuine composite view, without that event show subview button navigating?

- add snippets to readme at very end

Why did you call them events -_-
