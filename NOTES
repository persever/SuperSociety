- signout goes to session url, fix that to redirect to new users (very low priority)

- currentusermanagedgroups is all groups because no groups spcified so it auto fetches all in namespace init

- filepicker for sign up but not sign in...
- make users/new route something more appropriate to dual functionality...
- make new users form not shared anymore? you need to make the naming more clear
- look up good practices for making single-page sing in/ups

- make group composite view for eventshow or eventsindex

- make group and events forms modals


- make filepicker more site appropriate

- make appropriate rails route hits redirect to appropriate static page route
