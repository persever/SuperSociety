> filepicker redirect?
> frontend assocs? (toggle?)

- sign in and out and do things with multiple users, make sure that's not messing up

- clear out old unused files, unless useful to show process... but you have that in your readme so it probably just looks cluttered. it is just clutter.

- search bar in nav if not on search page? (if on group page)

- clean up all comments, KEEP LINES WITHIN LENGTH LIMIT, refactor long and messy things, make sure naming is comprehensible

- super low priority: upcoming events count in nav

- REMOVE COMMENTS
- simplicity! tidiness!

Why did you call them events -_-
