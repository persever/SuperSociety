- shadows on all boxes
- member/attender banner dimensions

- simple custom 404 pages
- FriendlyId
- dimensionality (diagonal slice on buttons, lighter above darker below -- same for logo)
- mouse reactivity!! (gii clear h3 and screen!)

- how to handle groups with long names? it'd be nicer to have bigger name fonts... back to h3, ellipses cutting off after 10 char?

- clean up associations!!!

- can't make event if don't have group!
