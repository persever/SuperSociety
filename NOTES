PRIORITY:

- group show shadows
- eii gii stronger shadows
>>> NORMALIZE THE SHADOWS

- min width!
- eii going offscreen when go back to group page from event show

- join button post error (guest signin, on event page)

- make cloudinary do just photos

- on login "cannot read property name of null" for index (group/group_id thing?)

- one-liner on signin/up page to make clear what the site's use is
- make guest signin more clear to first-time user
- upload new group photo in place of old one!
- background
- navbar counter glow in and out -- direct guest user!!

- "groups i manage" button
- User profiles? name on hover at least

- uncrowd group show... put the screen over images, not covering whole thing, semi-transparent, image behind blurred
- guest login autotype
- rotate guests between three set users! more seeds for those users!
- center the group index grid paragraph style
- style giis like meetup does, they look awful right now
- lose button hover glow, just make buttons go med-light (or med-dark?) (except join and submit) >> and make it animated fade-in!

TO FINISH, SOMEWHAT IN ORDER:

- reconsider colors (white nav?)
- gradient on group name and nav logo (and signin logo?)
- fix submit button
- resize modals
- switch colors with class toggle on attend/subscribe buttons
- jQuery UI toggle class / color animation for smooth toggle button transitions
- fixed nav event counter
- pull homepage header counters right and make fancier
- gii bigger font, wrap name

- (ta help?) make logout button on nav work correctly

- stop cursor from turning into text indicator, make it just clickable or not
- custom (simple circle) cursor for button/a/other clickable hover
- guest login autotype
- make errors on forms look a little nicer
- handle "enter" key from description textarea to submit forms

- eliminate code (models, colls, views!) not using
- clean up controllers and routes
- clean up all comments
- refactor long and messy things, and any logic that should be in a different file
- organize methods alphabetically
- KEEP LINES WITHIN LENGTH LIMIT

- Heroku walkthrough: MAKE ALL CLICKABLES WORK, BE ABLE TO WALK THROUGH EVERY SINGLE ASPECT, IN AND OUT, SMOOTHLY
- is the route ever saying "groups/undefined"? on back button?
> no unintended effects! (like clicking join/leave from index also directing to show page! or clicks from something that shouldn't be clickable, or clicks to somewhere wrong or double-handled!)
- check out app in firefox, on a aa computer!
- add webkit and moz to scss as needed! radius, shadow, gradients, etc!

- db reset both (and migrate heroku) and push to both

- BLOG POST
- add snippets to readme

- auto reset heroku db every single night!
- a few more iron man seeds in case some employers delete a lot!!
- clear new from cloudinary regularly too...

- sound
- garageband clip and fade the audio! rails can handle the audio right? if not can link to youtube vid but that's less reliable (do that first though).

- change signout button to power symbol
- tags for groups and events top priority bonuses, and calendar!
- welcome screen video and epic music behind login/signup modal (heimdall + bridge video???)
- make bootstrap nav collapse at like 300px, no bigger
- marvel-esque google font for other font

- update readme, incl bonuses; check off boxes

- center things properly, with t/l:calc(50% - [].h/w / 2)
- change all ssevent(s)/event(s) to their appropriate respective names so code is not confusing

- remove button blue glow
- texture background (comic book city? semi-transparent?)
- shadows on all boxes
- member/attender banner dimensions

- make logout symbol power down (unlight)

EXTRA:

- signin video or (later!) animate electricity

- entry page one-liner!
- nicer fonts! (look at some fancy sites)

- customize cloudinary a little (just colors and button!)

- 'no events' placeholder for groups with no events (like 'i have powers because science')
- simple custom 404 pages
- dimensionality
- mouse reactivity!! (gii clear h3 and screen!)

- how to handle groups with long names? it'd be nicer to have bigger name fonts... back to h3, ellipses cutting off after 10 char?

- get rid of currentUserManagedGroups assoc and any other related mess
- clean up associations!!!

- can't make event if don't have group!

- footer (stuck below bottom!)
- homepage button for user's past events index
- tab on group page for past events index
- past event views should have a frozen attending button

- better looking select dropdown
- make form error messages appear inside offending inputs? with red glow around offending box (that goes away on new input!)!
- fade effect on every route change
- group subscribe from index
- reduce queries
- at least a little responsiveness?
