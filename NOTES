- internal scroll: overflow y scroll to scroll

- make bootstrap nav collapse at like 300px, no bigger

- in header bar on home page, put count of upcoming events (which switches in approp index subv)

---

- get rid of currentUserManagedGroups assoc and any other related mess
- why is server running/showing everything twice? low priority


- handle enter key in search
- handle enter ans esc keys on modal forms

- seed live action photos for users and groups

- root url background video behind semi-transparent black screen behind buttons if no current user

- guest signin autotype

- custom mouse image (white circle? comic book bang effect image?)

- make every route call redirect to signin page if no current user... currently tacks it on....

- make filepicker more site appropriate
- make appropriate rails route hits redirect to appropriate static page route
- make group genuine composite view, without that event show subview button navigating?

- delete events and groups
> reset db every night at a weird hour! set enough seeds for a day of employers to delete!!!
- edit groups and events!!!
- ensure browser back button works :O

- add snippets to readme at very end
> filepicker redirect?
> frontend assocs? (toggle?)

- sign in and out and do things with multiple users, make sure that's not messing up

- clear out old unused files, unless useful to show process... but you have that in your readme so it probably just looks cluttered. it is just clutter.

- check out app in firefox

- search bar in nav if not on search page? (if on group page)

- clean up all comments, KEEP LINES WITHIN LENGTH LIMIT, refactor long and messy things, make sure naming is comprehensible

- super low priority: upcoming events count in nav

- note used bootstrap nav, search bar plugin, other big snipps
- REMOVE COMMENTS
- simplicity! tidiness!

Why did you call them events -_-
